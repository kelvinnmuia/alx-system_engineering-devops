# 0x00. Shell, basics

In this project, I learnt about the basic shell commands including: 
**Shell Navigation Commands**, such as `cd`, `pwd`, `ls` `less`for navigating 
directories and the shell. **File Manipulation Commands** , such as `cp` `mv`, 
`rm`, `touch`, `file`. **Help Commands** , such as `help` `man`. Finally, I 
practiced working with other commands, such as `type`, `which`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`.
